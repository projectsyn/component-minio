= Upgrade from v1.x to v2.x

With the upgrade from v1.x to v2.x the helm chart used for minio has changed.

This will cause a few changes in the manifests because of this.
Further more some parameters have been deprecated:

== Deprecated parameters

=== `adminCredentials.accessKey`
This parameter has been replaced in favor of `adminCredentials.rootUser`

=== `adminCredentials.secretKey`
This parameter has been replaced in favor of `adminCredentials.rootPassword`

== Changed helmValues
Because the helm chart was changed,
some parameters might not be available anymore.

Please refer to the https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/helm/minio/values.yaml[official helm chart] for the available values.
